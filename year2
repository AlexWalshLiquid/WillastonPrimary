<h3>Time flies when you&rsquo;re having fun!</h3>
<p>I cannot believe we are now into the summer term!</p>
<p>Last term was jam packed as always. We compared the Masai community in Africa, with our community in Willaston. We looked at the similarities and differences and learnt lots of interesting African facts! We were able to end our topic with a trip to Chester Zoo and this has produced some amazing writing, which is now displayed in the infant corridor.</p>

<p>Our Easter celebrations included a trip to church which meant we were able to consolidate and develop our understanding of the Easter story. We were lucky to have been part of an Easter experience led by year 5. The children thoroughly enjoyed being taught by their peers, as they moved around each station learning about the key events of this important Christian festival.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In science, we have observed the lifecycle of a frog, as well as the lifecycle of a butterfly. These animals have now been returned back safely to their natural habitats.</p>
<p>Our enterprise week was a great success and the children enjoyed growing plants and making plant pots in the style of Eric Carle. We then sold these plants and pots on our market stall.</p>

<p>The summer term class newsletter is now attached and this will give you more information of what&rsquo;s planned this term.  The time is nearly upon us, when we set off for our overnight stay at Beeston. While we are there, we will enjoy a trip to the famous Beeston Castle, as well as a visit to the Candle Workshop. More information will be given at our information evening on Thursday 5<sup>th</sup> May 2016. &nbsp;I will update this page with photographs, as soon as we return.</p>
Forest School dates are now confirmed and these can be found under the forest school class page. The children are benefiting immensely from these sessions, as they develop their self-esteem and confidence, as well as learning to love and respect their outdoor environment. &nbsp;
<p>This term, the children will enjoy a weekly singing lesson with a qualified singing teacher and they also have the opportunity to join a lunchtime rounder&rsquo;s club. Letters have now been sent home with the children, which contains more details.</p>
<p>What an exciting term we have ahead of us!</p>

<p>As always, I will keep you fully updated of what&rsquo;s going on in class, via our weekly homework letter. Don&rsquo;t forget drop-in sessions continue to be available on Mondays, between 3.15pm and 3.45pm, for you to discuss with me any concerns you may have. You can also arrange a time to speak to myself on the phone or I am able to offer a meeting at a later time, by prior arrangement.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support.</p>
