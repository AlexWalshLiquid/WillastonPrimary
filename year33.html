<h2>Welcome to our final term in Year 3!</h2>

<p>Where has the time gone? The children are so much more mature and independent now and have really come into their own as Juniors;
 they had a fabulous bonding experience on last term&rsquo;s residential and were absolutely marvellous in our KS2 performance.
  I have no doubt that they will be more than ready to move up to Year 4 in September and our transition week (4th to 8th July)
   will ensure the children are happy and confident to move into a new class.</p>


<p>We are now enjoying a term of Samba drumming which will culminate in a performance to parents; 
	the children absolutely love it, especially the A-Go-Go Bells! Many skills are required when drumming,
 		not only keeping a beat and a rhythm but also listening carefully to those around us and responding to instructions. So far...so good!</p>
			
            
   <p>  In our Maths lessons we are studying Geometry and then moving on to a series of revision sessions to review everything we have learnt so far in Year 3.
		This term in particular our maths work will entail a lot of problem solving, applying all the skills and concepts we have covered thus far.</p>

<p>In English we will also be consolidating our learning with a particular focus on spelling and spelling rules, adverbials,&nbsp;apostrophes and subordinate clauses.
 Now the children are confident readers it is even more important than ever that we focus on comprehension and that the children read extensively both in school and at home,
  completing their reading logs as they go. Our class texts this term include &rsquo;The Day the Crayons Quit&rsquo; by Oliver Jeffers, a hilarious account of crayons going on strike
   which the children will love! Plants, Light and Shadow are our topics in Science; focusing on the life cycle of a plant (in particular pollination) and&nbsp;studying the conditions
    required for growing healthy plants &mdash; we have already planted seedlings and now have them growing (or not!) in various conditions around the school&mdash;including in fridge and 
    a cupboard!
    
    
In Geography we will be studying South America and contrasting it to the UK, using cocoa production and consumption as the medium for accessing this fascinating part of the world.&nbsp;
History is continuing to take us into the exciting world of Ancient Egypt; we will be making our own canopic jars, creating silhouette pictures of pyramids and camels and finding out all about the process of mummification! </span></span></p>
Our I-pads are still being put to constant good use through independent research, Scratch Junior and I-movies&nbsp;and are used across the curriculum. In RE we are continuing our focus on Christian celebrations and festivals in contrast to those in the Islam faith, and French is taking us into the world of children&rsquo;s hobbies, likes and dislikes, together with revision on&nbsp;numbers, days of the week/months of the year,&nbsp;simple greetings and colours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This term will also see the whole school come together on a book project; we will be creating a vast array of wonderful&nbsp;artwork and writing which will adorn every nook and cranny of our school. I&rsquo;m sure the children will take much pleasure in coming together and sharing this experience with each other and with our wider community and it will be a fitting way to close an exciting year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
If there is anything you would like to talk to me about, please drop in on a Monday at 3.30 or we can arrange a mutually convenient time. My door is always open!&nbsp;</span></span></p>
Thank you as ever for your continuing support, <br />
